            <p>
                Twingo is a portmanteau of the words twist and tango. The name can also be interpreted as a combination of the words twin and go, where the word "twin" refers to the idea of having two cars in one, a compact car and a minivan. This memorable name was coined by Manfred Gotta.

        <p>
            Not just affordable to buy, Renault's small cars have historically been cheap to run. The first generation Twingo followed suit, with its technical simplicity, low weight and low fuel consumption. Many components were reused from Clio and other Renault cars, further reducing the cost of maintenance.

            <p>
                The first generation Twingo was sold in France for FF 55,000. A good example of Renault's attempts to reduce costs is the radio antenna housed on the side mirror. Why is it there? Because it saves on the length of the antenna cable..

            <h1>Style</h1>
            <p>
                What the Twingo lacked in equipment, it made up for in style. The exterior was utilitarian but playful, while the sparse interior was livened up by vibrant patterns and colourful switches and door handles. The Twingo is a perfect example of the expressive and playful design of the 90's.
Especially with the current trend of angry and aggressive car design, the sight of Twingo's joyful smile reminds you that maybe the world isn't so bad after all.
