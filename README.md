# 🚗 Renault Twingo Fan Page

A simple web project dedicated to one of the most iconic and charming small cars ever made — the Renault Twingo.

This is my first project and a fun way to practice HTML, CSS, and maybe some JavaScript while celebrating a car that proves personality comes in small packages.

## 🚘 About the Renault Twingo

First introduced in **1992**, the Renault Twingo redefined what a small city car could be. With its *friendly face*, *compact size*, and surprisingly spacious interior, the Twingo quickly became a European classic. 

Throughout its generations, the Twingo stayed true to its quirky, functional spirit — from the original one-box design of the first generation to the rear-engined, rear-wheel-drive surprise of the third.

Why the Twingo?

- It was bold and different when most small cars looked the same.
- It combined French charm with clever engineering.
- It's fun to drive, easy to park, and hard not to love.

This site is a small tribute to a car that didn't just take people from A to B — it made the journey more fun.
